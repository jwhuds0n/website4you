            <p> OK, so if you're someone that doesn't need a truck all the time but need something moved from time to time this site for you or if you're someone that has a truck and doesn't really use it that much to it's fully functional potential. This site is also for you so you can make a little bit of cash at the same time you're helping someone that is in need but not constantly in need so I figure what this site maybe we could start something you know maybe a chat board and kind build on one another to help people out and start our own little foundation to get this thing going because I know there's places out there. You can go rent a truck, but you have not only have to pay to get there you have to get you have to take it home. You're on a time limit this way you're helping each other out doing on each other schedules you meet making an agreement on how much you guys wanna pay one another you know and be honest about it.
